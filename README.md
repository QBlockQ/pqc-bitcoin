# **pqcBitcoin**

This repository is the result of a collaborative effort between [QBlock](https://github.com/QBlockQ) & [Qbits](https://github.com/QbitsCode), working together to build a future-proof version of Bitcoin Core that can withstand the potential threats posed by quantum computers. The integration of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms into Bitcoin Core is a key initiative in ensuring that Bitcoin remains secure in the advent of quantum computing.

Quantum computing represents a breakthrough in computational capabilities, but it also poses a significant risk to current cryptographic techniques, including the elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) widely used in Bitcoin today. These classical encryption methods could potentially be broken by powerful quantum computers, leading to vulnerabilities in blockchain technologies. To mitigate this, the integration of quantum-resistant algorithms into Bitcoin Core is imperative.

## **Overview**

Quantum computers poses a potential threat to current cryptographic methods, including those used in Bitcoin, like elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). This project investigates incorporating post-quantum cryptographic algorithms to secure Bitcoin transactions and wallets in the event of future quantum attacks.

The goal is to make Bitcoin Core quantum-resistant by adopting algorithms that remain secure even in a world with powerful quantum computers.

## **Features**

- **Integration of PQC Algorithms**: Implements quantum-safe cryptographic algorithms alongside existing Bitcoin protocols.
- **Quantum-Resistant Wallets**: Modify Bitcoin Core's wallet functionality to utilize PQC keys for enhanced security.
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility with Bitcoin's current cryptographic algorithms for users not yet ready to switch to PQC.

## **Current PQC Algorithms Implemented**

### Group 1: Digital Signature Algorithms
- **SPHINCS+**: A stateless hash-based signature scheme with minimal security assumptions.
- **CRYSTALS-Dilithium**: A lattice-based digital signature scheme.
- **FALCON**: A fast lattice-based digital signature scheme optimized for small signatures.
- **SQIsign**: An isogeny-based signature scheme.

### Group 2: Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEM)
- **Kyber**: A lattice-based key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) for public-key encryption.
- **FrodoKEM**: A key encapsulation mechanism based on the hardness of the learning with errors (LWE) problem.
- **NTRU**: A lattice-based public-key cryptosystem designed to be secure against quantum computers.

These algorithms are integrated into the Bitcoin codebase in a way that ensures both backward and forward compatibility with existing Bitcoin infrastructure. Group 1 algorithms handle digital signatures for transaction signing, while Group 2 algorithms provide secure key exchange mechanisms for encrypted communications between nodes and wallets.

## **Post-Quantum Cryptography Support**

This fork of Bitcoin Core implements post-quantum cryptography (PQC) to provide protection against quantum computer attacks while maintaining backward compatibility with the existing Bitcoin network.
